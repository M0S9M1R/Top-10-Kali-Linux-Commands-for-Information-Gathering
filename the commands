Top 10 Kali Linux Commands for Information Gathering:-
Information gathering is a crucial phase in penetration testing and security assessments. Below are the top 10 tools I use in Kali Linux for information gathering, along with detailed examples and explanations.

1.Nmap
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful network discovery and security auditing tool. It can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network.
Example:
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
Explanation:
- `-sP`: Ping scan - only checks to see if hosts are up.
- `192.168.1.0/24`: Scans all IP addresses in the subnet 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.

More advanced usage:
nmap -A -T4 -p 1-65535 192.168.1.1
- `-A`: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
- `-T4`: Aggressive timing template.
- `-p 1-65535`: Scans all 65535 ports.

2.Whois
Whois is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or an IP address block.
Example:
whois example.com
Explanation:
example.com: Replace with the domain name you want to query to get information about its registrant.

3. Dnsenum
Dnsenum is a multithreaded Perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous IP blocks.
Example:
bash
dnsenum example.com
Explanation:
example.com: Replace with the domain name you want to enumerate to get DNS information.

4.TheHarvester
TheHarvester is used for gathering emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and SHODAN.
Example:
theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b google
Explanation:
- `-d example.com`: Specifies the domain to search.
- `-l 500`: Limits the number of results to 500.
- `-b google`: Uses Google as the search engine.

5.Nikto
Nikto is an open-source web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, versions on over 1250 servers, and version-specific problems on over 270 servers.
Example:
nikto -h http://example.com
Explanation:
-h http://example.com`: Specifies the target URL.

6.Metasploit
Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks. It provides the infrastructure, content, and tools to perform comprehensive penetration tests and extensive security auditing.
Example:
msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.0/24
run
Explanation:
- `msfconsole`: Starts the Metasploit console.
- `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`: Uses the TCP port scanner module.
- `set RHOSTS 192.168.1.0/24`: Sets the target range.
- `run`: Executes the module.

7.Maltego
Maltego is a program that can be used to determine the relationships and real-world links between people, groups of people (social networks), companies, websites, internet infrastructure, phrases, documents, and files, and many more.
Example:
maltego
Explanation:
- `maltego`: Starts the Maltego GUI application.

8.Shodan
Shodan is a search engine for Internet-connected devices. It allows you to find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) using various filters.
Example:
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
shodan search apache
Explanation:
- `shodan init YOUR_API_KEY`: Initializes Shodan with your API key.
- `shodan search apache`: Searches for devices running Apache.

9.SpiderFoot
SpiderFoot is an open-source intelligence automation tool. It automates the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which can be a domain name, hostname, IP address, subnet, ASN, or even an email address.
Example:
spiderfoot -s example.com
Explanation:
- `-s example.com`: Specifies the target domain to gather intelligence on.

10.Netcat
Netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using the TCP or UDP protocols. It is designed to be a dependable back-end tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.
Example:
nc -v -z -w 1 192.168.1.1 1-1000
Explanation:
- `-v`: Verbose mode.
- `-z`: Zero-I/O mode, used for scanning.
- `-w 1`: Timeout for connections.
- `192.168.1.1 1-1000`: Scans ports 1 through 1000 on the host 192.168.1.1.
